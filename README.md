# Audio Denoising and Super-Resolution using Autoencoders

## Overview
This project implements a deep learning model that removes noise, reconstructs missing data, and enhances low-resolution audio signals. The system uses an encoder-decoder architecture with skip connections and subpixel shuffling to enable high-fidelity audio restoration.

## Model Architecture
The model consists of two main modules - **Encoder** and **Decoder** with a **bottleneck layer** connecting them. Each side contains equal numbers of blocks to ensure balanced downsampling and upsampling.

### Encoder
- Performs **downsampling** on input signals.
- Each block uses **Dilated Convolutions** and **ReLU** activation.
- Dilated convolutions expand the receptive field, improving feature extraction while preserving computational efficiency.

### Decoder
- Performs **upsampling** of encoded features.
- Each block contains **Dilated Convolution**, **ReLU activation**, **Dropout**, **Subpixel Shuffling**, and **Stacking** layers.
- Subpixel shuffling maps tensor dimensions to rearrange data for precise reconstruction.
- Outputs are concatenated with features from the encoder through skip connections for minimal information loss.

### Bottleneck Layer
- Connects encoder and decoder via successive downsampling/upsampling blocks.
- Uses convolution, batch normalization, and **Leaky ReLU** activation.
- Enables efficient information compression between feature maps.

### Skip Connections
- Allow the model to learn residuals (y - x), improving training stability and audio quality.

### Mathematical Summary
- Downsampling block: \( b = 1, 2, ..., B \)
- Convolution filters: \( \text{max}(2^{(6+b)}, 512) \)
- Filter length: \( \text{min}(2^{(7b)} + 1, 9) \)
- Stride: 2
